Examples

   Here are some examples of Internet date/time format.

      1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z

   This represents 20 minutes and 50.52 seconds after the 23rd hour of
   April 12th, 1985 in UTC.

      1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00

   This represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of
   December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC (Pacific
   Standard Time).  Note that this is equivalent to 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z
   in UTC.

      1990-12-31T23:59:60Z

   This represents the leap second inserted at the end of 1990.

      1990-12-31T15:59:60-08:00

   This represents the same leap second in Pacific Standard Time, 8
   hours behind UTC.

      1937-01-01T12:00:27.87+00:20

   This represents the same instant of time as noon, January 1, 1937,
   Netherlands time.  Standard time in the Netherlands was exactly 19
   minutes and 32.13 seconds ahead of UTC by law from 1909-05-01 through
   1937-06-30.  This time zone cannot be represented exactly using the
   HH:MM format, and this timestamp uses the closest representable UTC
   offset.
